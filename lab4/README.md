In this task, you will learn how to create an approval flow that will handle the approval before deploying to production.

1. Go to the [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).

2. Check if you are in the **Prod** environment and if not, switch to that environment.

    ![](./assets/check-environment-prod.png)

3. Select **Flows (1)** from the left navigation pane, the select **New flow (2)** in the command bar at the top and select **Automated cloud flow (3)**.

    ![](./assets/extend-pipeline-create-automated-cloud-flow(1).png)

4. This will open a pop up where you can name your flow and configure a trigger. 

    - Name your flow as **My first pipeline production approval (1)**, 
    - Search for **action (2)**,
    - Select the Microsoft Dataverse trigger  **When an action is performed (3)** and
    - Select the **Create (4)** button.  

        ![](./assets/extend-pipeline-cloud-flow-trigger(1).png)

5. Configure the trigger inputs by making it look like the screenshot below.

7. Select the **Add** button below trigger conditions to add a trigger condition.

    ![](./assets/extend-pipeline-cloud-flow-trigger-settings-add-condition.png)

8. Add the following trigger condition to make sure the cloud flow only triggers when the pipeline name is equal to **My first pipeline**.

    ```
    @equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentPipelineName'], 'My first pipeline')
    ```

9. Select the **Add** button below the trigger condition above to add another trigger condition.    

    ![](./assets/extend-pipeline-cloud-flow-trigger-settings-add-another-condition.png)

10. Add the following trigger condition to make sure the cloud flow only triggers when the pipeline name is equal to **Deploy to prod**.

    ```
    @equals(triggerOutputs()?['body/OutputParameters/DeploymentStageName'], 'Deploy to prod')
    ```

11. Select the **Done** button at the bottom of the trigger card to save the trigger conditions.

    ![](./assets/extend-pipeline-cloud-flow-unbound-actions.png)

23. Click on **Save** to save the flow.

### Task 1.3 : Test and Execute "Deploy to Prod" with Approval Process

In this task, you are going to find out if the approval you configured in the last task actually works!

1. Go to the [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Ensure you're in the **Dev** environment; if you're not, switch to it.

    ![](./assets/check-environment-dev.png)

1. Go to **Solutions (1)** in the left menu. Select the **MPPC 23 (2)** solution.

    ![](./assets/run-first-pipeline-dev(1).png)

1. Select the **Pipelines** from the left.

    ![](./assets/run-first-pipeline-solution(1).png)

1. Earlier in this lab, you have made a Pre-Deployment Step required. That means that now, there is an info box on the deploy to prod stage.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-info.png)

1. Select the purple **Deploy here** button.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval.png)  

1. This will open a new sidebar which will give you the option to start your deployment now or plan your deployment for later. Select the purple **Next** button to go to the next screen.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-select-target.png)  

1. Leave everything as default and select the **Next** button.

    >This will lead you to the next section called **Summary**. Here you can find a bunch of info about the solution you are about to deploy to the QA environment. It also shows an AI suggested solution overview.

    ![](./assets/run-first-pipeline-summary-ai-prod.png)

1. When you're happy with that AI generated solution overview, select the **Apply** button below the AI suggested solution overview.
Now the AI suggested solution overview is added in the **Deployment notes** box.

    ![](./assets/run-first-pipeline-ai-generated-description-approved-prod.png)

1. Review the AI-suggested solution overview to ensure it's free of errors, and make corrections if necessary.

1. Select the **Deploy** button.

1. Next, you will see the following screen, that shows a yellow box which states that **Your request to deploy here is pending**.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-pending.png)

1. This message is showing because our changes in the beginning of the lab made sure that the Power Automate cloud flow is now triggered. We are working on a fresh environment, so it can take a while before the approval solution is deployed. Best is to take a break now, since it can take 5-10 minutes before your next step.

1. Open a new browser tab and go to [Outlook web](https://outlook.office.com) and wait for the approval email. After 5-10 minutes (only the first time!) it should arrive.

1. In the approval mail you will see a couple of familiar parts:  

    - You will see the title of the **Approval (1)**.  

    - You will see the **Deployment notes (2)**.  

    - You will see **Approve / Reject buttons (3)**.  

    - You will be able to add **Comments (4)**.  

    - You will be able to **Submit (5)** the approval / rejection.  

1. Make sure to select **Approve** in the approval email, add **Approved!** as comments and select the **Submit** button.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-outlook.png)  

1. Close the Outlook browser tab, and you will see (sometimes you have to refresh) that the deployment to production is in progress.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-in-progress.png)

1. After the deployment is finished, you will see that the deployment is finished.

    ![](./assets/run-deploy-to-prod-approval-finished.png)

And that's how the deployment with approvals works!

### Solution Checker Warning

In the meantime, you should've gotten another email.

1. Go to [Outlook web](https://outlook.office.com)

1. Look for an email with the subject **Solution checked for issues during import**.

    It should look something like this:

    ![](./assets/warn-solution-checker-prod.png)

    This email shows there are no solution checker issues found in our solution we just deployed to production: well done!
